# Azure DevOps Engineering Marketplace Extensions

AzureDevOps Marketplace Extensions to do various engineering tasks.

## Email Report Task
Generates a Report with the information from the pipeline and sends it as email. Goal is to provide all the relevant info happened in the pipeline, in a concise and neat manner. 

Read more [here](Tasks/emailReportTask/README.md).

## Pull Request Insights Task
PullRequestInsightsTask provides insights into pipelines. This extension has two main functions:

1. Investigating pull request validation failures
2. Alerting pull request owners to the introduction of long running tasks.

Read more [here](Tasks/pullRequestInsightsTask/README.md).

To build:

```
npm install
npm run build // builds all tasks
npm run build:t1 // build specific task - first task
npm run build:t2 // builds second task - Refer package.json
```

To run unit tests (at root): 

```
npm test
```

To run PullRequestInsights task E2E w/o installing it on a pipeline: 

```
npm run e2e:emailreport // or look below
npm run e2e:t1 // proxy for above
npm run e2e:t2 // proxy for prinsights
```
VS Code Debugging option is also available. Use launch.json under .vscode directory.
Note: E2E test(s) will fail by default with 401 errors as the restclients are not authenticated without providing correct credentials. Change E2E test code to supply correct credentials to test the scenario.

Packaging:

Run the pack command for each task. t1/t2/... are shortcuts for tasks in alphabhetical order. Please check package.json to confirm or use the actual names if preferred.
```
npm run pack:t1 // if option not specified, "dev" is default. Doesn't create VSIX.
npm run pack:t1 prod // creates VSIX for emailReport
npm run pack:t2  // Doesn't create VSIX
npm run pack:t2 prod // Creates VSIX for pullRequestInsights
```
Note: Option "dev" doesn't create a VSIX file. Instead, it prepares the output task folder ready for upload to an AzureDevOps account and test it.

### TEMPORARY HACK for azure-devops-node-api bug

Currently, there's a bug in "queryTestResultsReportForBuild" API of azure-devops-node-api lib which causes a break in the email report data and make it report incorrectly. Until "9.0.2" version of this lib is released - below hack must be done:
Go to "node_modules/azure-devops-node-api/Serialization.js" and change line number 216 from "return false" to "break". Should look like below. 

Before publishing the emailreport task, do the same under "dist/emailreportextensions/emailreporttask/node_modules" folder (after running npm run pack:t1 but before tfx command). 

```
if (lowerCaseEnumName !== enumName) {
    for (var name in enumType.enumValues) {
        var value = enumType.enumValues[name];
        if (name.toLowerCase() === lowerCaseEnumName) {
            resultPart = value;
            break; // replacing return false
        }
    }
}
```
